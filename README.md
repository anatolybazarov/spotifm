# spotifm (1.3.0-beta)

spotifm streams your spotify music over the internet using icecast2 and spawns a rest api

> note: spotifm only works with spotify premium accounts

there is an included:
* irc bot which can be used to control the radio through irc commands
* discord bot which streams the radio to a voice channel, and can be controlled through text channels

## quick start
### 1) configuration
edit `config.json.example` and rename it to `config.json` 

```
    "user": "your@email.com",
    "pass": "yourpass1",
    "uris": [
        "spotify:playlist:2WvtFSAkmcABdm3iAvYwXk"
    ],
    "elevenlabs": {
        "key": "",
        "voice": ""
    }
```

`user` is your email

`pass` is your password

`uris` is a list of spotify URIs (track, album or playlist) to play once started (`spotify:track:<ID>` or `spotify:album:<ID>` or `spotify:playlist:<ID>`)

optionally:

`elevenlabs` contains your elevenlabs API key, and the voice ID of the voice you want to use for TTS

### 2) track announcments and bumpers (optional)

spotifm can announce the name of the song before it plays, as well as periodically play radio station bumpers of your choosing, configured as follows:

```
    "announce": {
        "song": {
            "enable": false,
            "espeak": {
                "gap": 10,
                "speed": 150,
                "pitch": 50,
                "voice": "en-us",
                "amplitude": 100
            }
        },
        "bumper": {
            "enable": false,
            "freq": 20,
            "tags": [
                "you are listening to my radio"
            ],
            "espeak": {
                "gap": 10,
                "speed": 120,
                "pitch": 50,
                "voice": "en-us",
                "amplitude": 100
            }
        }
    }
```

they are disabled by default

`freq` is how often to play a bumper

see `espeak` manual for description of `gap`, `speed`, `pitch`, `voice` and `amplitude`

### 2) build spotifm

`docker compose run builder`


### 3) deploy spotifm
`docker compose up -d --force-recreate streamer`

> icecast2 will become available on port `8000`

> spotifm will spawn a rest api on port `9090`

### 4) irc bot (optional)
make sure to edit `ircbot.json.example` and rename it to `ircbot.json`, then

`docker compose up -d ircbot`
