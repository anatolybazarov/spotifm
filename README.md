# spotifm (2.0.0)

spotifm streams your spotify music over the internet using icecast2 and spawns a rest api

> note: spotifm only works with spotify premium accounts

there is an included:
* irc bot which can be used to control the radio through irc commands
* discord bot which streams the radio to a voice channel, and can be controlled through text channels

the commands for both the irc and discord bot:
* `!np` `!prev` `!next` - get the now playing, previous, and next track in the playlist
* `!play <query>` - play this song on the stream immediately
* `!queue <query>` - queue this song to be played next
* `!search <query>` - get top 5 search results for your query
* `!shuffle` - shuffle the playlist

## quick start
### 1) configuration
edit `config.json.example` and rename it to `config.json` 

```
    "user": "your@email.com",
    "pass": "yourpass1",
    "uris": [
        "spotify:playlist:2WvtFSAkmcABdm3iAvYwXk"
    ],
    "elevenlabs": {
        "key": "",
        "voice": ""
    }
```

`user` is your email

`pass` is your password

`uris` is a list of spotify URIs (track, album or playlist) to play once started (`spotify:track:<ID>` or `spotify:album:<ID>` or `spotify:playlist:<ID>`)

optionally:

`elevenlabs` contains your elevenlabs API key, and the voice ID of the voice you want to use for TTS

### 2) track announcments and bumpers (optional)

spotifm can announce the name of the song before it plays, as well as periodically play radio station bumpers of your choosing, configured as follows:

```
    "announce": {
        "song": {
            "enable": false,
            "espeak": {
                "gap": 10,
                "speed": 150,
                "pitch": 50,
                "voice": "en-us",
                "amplitude": 100
            }
        },
        "bumper": {
            "enable": false,
            "freq": 20,
            "tags": [
                "you are listening to my radio"
            ],
            "espeak": {
                "gap": 10,
                "speed": 120,
                "pitch": 50,
                "voice": "en-us",
                "amplitude": 100
            }
        }
    }
```

they are disabled by default

`freq` is how often to play a bumper

see `espeak` manual for description of `gap`, `speed`, `pitch`, `voice` and `amplitude`

### 3) build spotifm

`docker compose run builder`

> note: depending on your docker version, you may need to use `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose`

### 4) deploy spotifm
`docker compose up -d --force-recreate streamer`

> icecast2 will become available on port `8000`, listen to your radio at `http://<your-ip-address>:8000/listen`

> spotifm will spawn a rest api on port `9090`, issue api calls at `http://<your-ip-address>:9090/...`

### 5) irc bot (optional)
make sure to edit `ircbot.json.example` and rename it to `ircbot.json`, then

`docker compose up -d ircbot`

### 6) discord bot (optional)
make sure to edit `discordbot.json.example` and rename it to `discordbot.json`, then

`docker compose up -d discordbot`
